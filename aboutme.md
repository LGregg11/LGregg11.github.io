## Introduction

My name is Luke Gregory and I have been a Software Engineer since 2019. I consider myself an expert in both C# and 
Python, having used both consistently throughout my professional career, dabbling in different technologies and 
frameworks such as: Unity, .NET, WPF, and Django. As well as these, I've also had my fair share of experience in C++ and 
javascript.

## Education

I completed a 4-year Masters in Astrophysics at Cardiff University in 2019 with a first class honours.  
I loved my degree - especially in the latter years when the 'generic' physics classes faded out and the more 
'astro' heavy courses ramped up - and particularly enjoyed my dissertations that I completed in my 3rd and 4th year.  

Besides the astronomy side of my course (which was brilliant), part of the reason I enjoyed it so much was because it
was essentially a soft introduction into the world of software development.  

Throughout my course we were taught the basics of programming using **Python**. 
The first 2 years were a gradual ramp up through the basics, focusing primarily on the scientific uses of programming
(which basically meant we used a hefty amount of `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`).  

3rd and 4th year consisted of a *Computing* and *Data Analysis* modules where I learned the likes of different numerical 
statistical analysis methods such as: From [Runge-Kutta methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)
and [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) to
[Chi-squared distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution) and data smoothing.  
These courses came in handy for my 3rd year and 4th year dissertations titled
**_[How fast do molecular clouds grow?](https://lgregg11.github.io/2025-02-25-N-Body-Stellar-Simulations/)_** and 
**_[The role of dust in star formation](https://lgregg11.github.io/2025-02-25-Dust-In-Star-Formation/)_**

*By the way, huge shoutout to my supervisor for my 3rd year, 4th year **and** summer internship, **Paul C. Clark**.*

## Career

### Software Engineer - BAE Systems Naval Ships (09/19 - 10/23)

Throughout my career in BAE Systems I worked on tools and applications used in the management 
systems on all types of naval vessels that BAE Systems developed. This role required an SC clearance and therefore a 
solid understanding on the importance of security. I learned different languages like **C#**, **Python** and **C++**, 
developed apps in platforms and frameworks like **.NET**, **WPF**, **Django**, and how to create and monitor **CI/CD**
pipelines. Furthermore, I learned how to use the **AGILE** development workflow, how to **mentor** juniors, and 
**plan and design** applications through their entire lifecycle.

#### Junior Systems/Software Engineer

I started my career in BAE Systems Naval Ships as a Junior Systems Engineer, but quickly transitioned into a Junior 
Software Engineer. During my first 6 months I was more involved in the hardware specific projects - 'technical 
refreshes' as we called them - to bring some systems up to date with the latest tech. From this I learned skills in 
securing Windows systems via **GPOs**, **AppLocker**, **Scripts**, and also modifying boot drives to run and install 
applications automatically.  
I became a **STEM Ambassador** and **volunteered** in local schools with their after-school engineering programmes, as well 
as volunteering in careers fairs for the company to advertise our graduate schemes.

#### Junior -> Mid

The pandemic hit 6 months into my career, and the hardware project I was on was put on pause. This allowed me to 
transition more into more software heavy projects which was my introduction into **C#** and frameworks like **.NET**,
**WinForms** and **WPF**.  
During this time I had the opportunity to switch between multiple projects, working in teams of 3 up to teams of 15, 
learning from a variety of different developers.  
At the end of my first year, I was placed on a longer term project developed in **Python** using **Django** and 
other technologies like **GeoServer** to store, control and visualise geospatial data. This was my introduction to web 
development and django - granted it was an internal pointing web app (so not a lot of user management!) - but it was yet
another set of skills and knowledge that I was able to obtain relatively quickly. As a result I was promoted to 
a **Software Engineer** at my yearly review

#### Intro to lead development

I quickly became the **lead** developer on the geospatial application. I learned a vast amount during this time such as: setting up and monitoring
**CI/CD** in **Jenkins**, communicating effectively with customers and QA to ensure they were satisfied with security 
targets and requirements, and also learning to mentor developers on their placement years and starting their graduate
schemes.  
One the application was completed and delivered, I progressed onto a **C++** networking application to design and develop 
new protocols to fit into a legacy system. While this posed new challenges, it was quite an interesting time in my career
that allowed me to learn yet another language, but also learning more about **networking**, **optimisation** and 
**design**.  
As part of this role I saw myself mentoring a graduate through their 3rd year of their 4 year scheme, helping where 
needed to ensure they were getting along with their course and collecting all the required information for their 
end of year presentation and project, and also helping with another placement student to understand the fundamentals of 
WPF.

### Software Engineer - Masters of Pie (10/23 - 01/25)
