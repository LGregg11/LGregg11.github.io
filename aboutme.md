## Introduction

My name is Luke Gregory and I have been a Software Engineer since 2019. I consider myself an expert in both C# and 
Python, having used both consistently throughout my professional career, dabbling in different technologies and 
frameworks such as: Unity, .NET, WPF, and Django. As well as these, I've also had my fair share of experience in C++ and 
javascript.

## Education

I completed a 4-year Masters in Astrophysics at Cardiff University in 2019 with a first class honours.  
I loved my degree - especially in the latter years when the 'generic' physics classes faded out and the more 
'astro' heavy courses ramped up - and particularly enjoyed my dissertations that I completed in my 3rd and 4th year.  

Besides the astronomy side of my course (which was brilliant), part of the reason I enjoyed it so much was because it
was essentially a soft introduction into the world of software development.  

Throughout my course we were taught the basics of programming using **Python**. 
The first 2 years were a gradual ramp up through the basics, focusing primarily on the scientific uses of programming
(which basically meant we used a hefty amount of `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`).  

3rd and 4th year consisted of a *Computing* and *Data Analysis* modules where I learned the likes of different numerical 
statistical analysis methods such as: From [Runge-Kutta methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)
and [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) to
[Chi-squared distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution) and data smoothing.  
These courses came in handy for my 3rd year and 4th year dissertations titled
**_[How fast do molecular clouds grow?](https://lgregg11.github.io/2025-02-25-N-Body-Stellar-Simulations/)_** and 
**_[The role of dust in star formation](https://lgregg11.github.io/2025-02-25-Dust-In-Star-Formation/)_**

*By the way, huge shoutout to my supervisor for my 3rd year, 4th year **and** summer internship, **Paul C. Clark**.*
